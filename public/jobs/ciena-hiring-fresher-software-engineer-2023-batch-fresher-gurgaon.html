The company has been described by The Baltimore Sun as the \"world's biggest player in optical connectivity.\" The company reported revenues of $3.62 billion for 2021. Ciena had over 7,200 employees, as of October 2021. Gary Smith serves as president and chief executive officer (CEO). Customers include AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, Korea Telecom, Sprint Corporation, and Verizon Communications. Ciena was founded in 1992 under the name HydraLite by electrical engineer David R. Huber. Huber served as chief executive officer, while Optelecom, a company building optical networking products, provided \"management assistance and production facilities,\" and co-founder Kevin Kimberlin \"provided initial equity capital during the formation of the Company\". The company subsequently received funding from Sevin Rosen Funds as a result of a demonstration at its laboratory attended by Jon Bayless, a partner at the firm, who saw the value in applying HydraLite's fiber-optic technology to cable television. Sevin Rosen offered funding immediately, investing $1.25 million in April 1994. Ciena received $40 million in venture capital financing, including $3.3 million from Sevin Rosen Funds. Other early investors in the company included Charles River Ventures, Japan Associated Finance Co., Star Venture, and Vanguard Venture Partners. Bayless also recruited physicist Patrick Nettles, a former colleague at the telecommunications company Optilink, to serve as Ciena's first CEO, and Lawrence P. Huang, another former colleague, to accept the sales chief role. Huber and Nettles, who changed the company's name to Ciena, began working from an office in Dallas in February 1994; Huber would remain with Ciena until 1995. The name of the company was changed to Ciena in 1994. Its first products were introduced in May 1996, and Sprint Corporation was the company's first customer. At $195 million, the company's first-year sales were the highest ever recorded by a startup at the time. Ciena had sold $54.8 million in products to Sprint alone by November 1996. WorldCom also became an early customer, and Sprint and WorldCom accounted for 97 percent of Ciena's revenue, as of early 1997. Ciena began diversifying its clientele and acquiring smaller contracts in 1997. Ciena went public on NASDAQ in February 1997, and was the largest initial public offering of a startup company to date, with a valuation of $3.4 billion. The company's headquarters were relocated to Maryland in March 1997. Ciena earned approximately $370 million in revenue and profits of $110 million for the fiscal year ending in October 1997. Customers at the time included AT&T, Bell Atlantic, and Digital Teleport. In March 1998, Nettles and Michael Birck of Tellabs began discussing a possible merger. Tellabs announced the purchase of Ciena for $7.1 billion in June. Revenue surpassed $700 million by August 1998, and Ciena had approximately 1,300 employees at the time. The merger was not completed. Financial performance and shareholder disapproval were cited in the media as reasons for the abandoned acquisition proposal in September 1998. Since 1992, Ciena has been driven by a relentless pursuit of network innovation.  We believe in a network that grows smarter, more agile, and more responsive every day. This means that when you digitally interact in your world - picking up the phone, streaming video, texting a friend or loved one – your interactions are being enabled by Ciena technologies.
