We believe that rising standards of living for a growing global population are likely to continue to drive demand for energy, including oil and gas, for years to come. At the same time, technology changes and the need to tackle climate change means there is a transition underway to a lower-carbon, multi-source energy system. <br> As one of the worldâ€™s leading energy companies, Shell plays a key role in meeting the worldâ€™s growing energy demand in economically, environmentally, and socially responsible ways. There has never been a more exciting time to be part of the energy industry. Join us in our ambition to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, and sooner if that is possible. <br> Shell is one of the most diversified international energy company in India with over 10,000 employees and presence across upstream, integrated gas, downstream, renewable energy, and deep capabilities in R&D, digitalization, and business operations. With a focus on digitization and future ready sustainable solutions, the company is nurturing a vibrant ecosystem in India to accelerate energy innovations with Shell E4 for start-ups, Shell Eco-marathon and investments in new energy companies. Shell also remains committed to making positive contributions to the communities in which it operates through programmes like NXplorers, Access to Energy and Road Safety across India. <br> This posting covers all roles across the Commercial, Corporate, and Technical programme. Shell matches you into a particular role based on your skills, so you will not be required to apply for a specific Shell position. However, if you are interested in a specific role, you can express your interest. <br><br> Deadline: The deadline for application is 31st July 2023. Early application is strongly recommended as Shell recruits on a rolling basis.  <br><br> Whats' The Role: <br> Our Graduate Programme is a rigorous development framework of specific competences, business-critical capabilities, and critical experiences that will enable you to become a competitive professional by the end of your 3-year programme. <br> Right from the start, you will be given a challenging hands-on role, working in a diverse, global environment. You will be supervised and mentored with frequent reviews as part of a structured development programme. You will also be learning alongside brilliant people from all over the world, with the resources and support to explore new ways of thinking and working â€“ all in all, an unbeatable experience. <br> We know that learning is key to developing yourself both personally and professionally.

Shell is a public limited company with a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and secondary listings on Euronext Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange. It is one of the oil and gas \"supermajors\" and by revenue and profits is consistently one of the largest companies in the world. Measured by both its own emissions, and the emissions of all the fossil fuels it sells, Shell was the ninth-largest corporate producer of greenhouse gas emissions in the period 1988â€“2015. Shell was formed in 1907 through the merger of Royal Dutch Petroleum Company of the Netherlands and The \"Shell\" Transport and Trading Company of the United Kingdom. The combined company rapidly became the leading competitor of the American Standard Oil and by 1920 Shell was the largest producer of oil in the world. Shell first entered the chemicals industry in 1929. Shell was one of the \"Seven Sisters\" which dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s. In 1964 Shell was a partner in the world's first commercial sea transportation of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In 1970 Shell acquired the mining company Billiton, which it subsequently sold in 1994 and now forms part of BHP. In recent decades gas has become an increasingly important part of Shell's business and Shell acquired BG Group in 2016. Shell is vertically integrated and is active in every area of the oil and gas industry, including exploration, production, refining, transport, distribution and marketing, petrochemicals, power generation, and trading. Shell has operations in over 99 countries, produces around 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and has around 44,000 service stations worldwide. As of 31 December 2019, Shell had total proved reserves of 11.1 billion barrels (1.76Ã—109 m3) of oil equivalent. Shell USA, its principal subsidiary in the United States, is one of its largest businesses. Shell holds 44% of RaÃ­zen, a publicly-listed joint venture with Cosan, which is the third-largest Brazil-based energy company. In addition to the main Shell brand, the company also owns the Jiffy Lube, Pennzoil and Quaker State brands. Shell is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index and had a market capitalisation of US$199 billion on 15 September 2022, the largest of any company listed on the LSE and the 44th-largest of any company in the world. By 2021 revenues, Shell is the second-largest investor-owned oil company in the world (after ExxonMobil), the largest company headquartered in the United Kingdom, the second-largest company headquartered in Europe (after Volkswagen), and the 15th largest company in the world. Until its unification in 2005 as Royal Dutch Shell plc, the firm operated as a dual-listed company, whereby the British and Dutch companies maintained their legal existence and separate listings but operated as a single-unit partnership. From 2005 to 2022 the company had its headquarters in The Hague, its registered office in London and had two types of shares (A and B). In January 2022, the firm merged the A and B shares, moved its headquarters to London, and changed its legal name to Shell plc.","datePosted":"2022-12-03","validThrough":"2023-12-30","employmentType":"Full-Time","hiringOrganization":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Shell Corporation","sameAs":"https://www.shell.in/","logo":"https://gofresher.in/company-logos/shell.png"},"jobLocation":{"@type":"Place","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"7, Bengaluru Hardware Park KIADB Industrial Park North, Mahadeva Kodigehalli, Bengaluru, Karnataka 562149","addressLocality":"India","addressRegion":"Bengaluru, Karnataka","postalCode":"562149","addressCountry":"India"}},"baseSalary":{"@type":"MonetaryAmount","currency":"INR","value":{"@type":"QuantitativeValue","value":"450000","unitText":"Yearly"}}}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"NewsArticle","sameAs":"","dateCreated":"2022-12-03T00:00:00+05:30","description":"View Internship Opportunities And Application Process","dateModified":"2022-12-03T00:00:00+05:30","datePublished":"2022-12-03T00:00:00+05:30","mainEntityOfPage":"https://gofresher.in/jobs/shell-corporation-internship-india-2023-pan-india-hiring.html","headline":"Internships | Shell Corporation, India","articleBody":"<br><br> A Note For Students & Graduates From Shell: Explore the wide range of opportunities that Shell has to offer top students and graduates, whether you're interested in working in a technical discipline, within commercial business, or for one of our corporate functions. <br><br> Shell Graduate Programme 2023 â€“ India <br><br> Location: Bangalore <br><br> Reference ID: R90821 <br><br> Employment Type: Full time <br><br> Experience level: Graduates <br><br> Country: India <br><br> Work Location (City): Bengaluru, Chennai, <br><br> Join Us For Powering The Change: <br> We are looking for graduates who share our purpose to power progress and our culture of inclusion, collaboration, and care.
