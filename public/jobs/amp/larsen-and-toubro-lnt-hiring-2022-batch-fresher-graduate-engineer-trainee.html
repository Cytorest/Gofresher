The company is counted among world's top five construction companies. It was founded by Henning Holck-Larsen and SÃ¸ren Kristian Toubro, who were two Danish engineers taking refuge in India. As of 2020, L&T Group comprises 118 subsidiaries, 6 associates, 25 joint-venture and 35 joint operations companies, operating across basic and heavy engineering, construction, realty, manufacturing of capital goods, information technology, and financial services. Three key products/services which L&T is engaged in are: Construction and project-related activity; manufacturing and trading activity; and engineering services. For administrative purposes, the firm has been structured into five broad categories:  <br><br> Construction â€“ this covers buildings & factories, heavy civil infrastructure, transportation infrastructure, power transmission & distribution, water & effluent treatment, metallurgical & material handling and smart world & communication; <br><br> EPC Projects â€“ this includes hydrocarbon engineering, power and power developments; <br><br> Manufacturing â€“ this includes defence equipment & systems, heavy engineering, construction, mining & industrial machinery, industrial valves and electrical & automation systems; <br><br> Larsen & Toubro originated from a company founded in 1946 in Bombay by two Danish engineers, Henning Holck-Larsen and SÃ¸ren Kristian Toubro. The company began as a representative of Danish manufacturers of dairy and allied equipment. However, with the start of the Second World War in 1939 and the resulting blockade of trade lines, the partners started a small workshop to undertake jobs and provide service facilities. Germany's invasion of Denmark in 1940 stopped supplies of Danish products. The war-time need to repair and refit and degauss ships offered L&T an opportunity, and led to the formation of a new company, Hilda Ltd, to handle these operations. L&T also started to repair and fabricate ships signalling the expansion of the company. The sudden internment of German engineers in British India (due to suspicions caused by the Second World War), who were to put up a soda ash plant for the Tatas, gave L&T a chance to enter the field of installation. <br><br> In 1946, ECC (Engineering Construction & Contracts) was incorporated by the partners; the company at this time was focused on construction projects (Presently, ECC is the construction division of L&T).

The company is counted among world's top five construction companies. It was founded by Henning Holck-Larsen and SÃ¸ren Kristian Toubro, who were two Danish engineers taking refuge in India. As of 2020, L&T Group comprises 118 subsidiaries, 6 associates, 25 joint-venture and 35 joint operations companies, operating across basic and heavy engineering, construction, realty, manufacturing of capital goods, information technology, and financial services. Three key products/services which L&T is engaged in are: Construction and project-related activity; manufacturing and trading activity; and engineering services. For administrative purposes, the firm has been structured into five broad categories:  <br><br> Construction â€“ this covers buildings & factories, heavy civil infrastructure, transportation infrastructure, power transmission & distribution, water & effluent treatment, metallurgical & material handling and smart world & communication; <br><br> EPC Projects â€“ this includes hydrocarbon engineering, power and power developments; <br><br> Manufacturing â€“ this includes defence equipment & systems, heavy engineering, construction, mining & industrial machinery, industrial valves and electrical & automation systems; <br><br> Larsen & Toubro originated from a company founded in 1946 in Bombay by two Danish engineers, Henning Holck-Larsen and SÃ¸ren Kristian Toubro. The company began as a representative of Danish manufacturers of dairy and allied equipment. However, with the start of the Second World War in 1939 and the resulting blockade of trade lines, the partners started a small workshop to undertake jobs and provide service facilities. Germany's invasion of Denmark in 1940 stopped supplies of Danish products. The war-time need to repair and refit and degauss ships offered L&T an opportunity, and led to the formation of a new company, Hilda Ltd, to handle these operations. L&T also started to repair and fabricate ships signalling the expansion of the company. The sudden internment of German engineers in British India (due to suspicions caused by the Second World War), who were to put up a soda ash plant for the Tatas, gave L&T a chance to enter the field of installation. <br><br> In 1946, ECC (Engineering Construction & Contracts) was incorporated by the partners; the company at this time was focused on construction projects (Presently, ECC is the construction division of L&T). L&T began several foreign collaborations. By 1947, the company represented British manufacturers of equipment used to manufacture products such as hydrogenated oils, biscuits, soaps and glass. In 1947, the company signed an agreement with Caterpillar Tractor Company, USA, for marketing earth moving equipment. At the end of the war, large numbers of war-surplus Caterpillar equipments were available at attractive prices, but the finances required were beyond the capacity of the partners. This prompted them to raise additional equity capital, and on 7 February 1946, Larsen & Toubro Private Limited was incorporated. <br><br> After India's independence in 1947, the firm set up offices in Calcutta (now Kolkata), Madras (now Chennai) and New Delhi. In 1948, 55 acres of undeveloped marsh and jungle was acquired in Powai, Mumbai. In December 1950, L&T became a public company with a paid-up capital of â‚¹20 lakh (equivalent to â‚¹19 crore or US$2.4 million in 2020).
