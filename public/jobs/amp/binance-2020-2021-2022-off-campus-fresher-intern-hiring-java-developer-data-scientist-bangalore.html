It was founded in 2017 and is registered in the Cayman Islands. Binance was founded by Changpeng Zhao, a developer who had previously created high frequency trading software. Binance was initially based in China, but later moved its headquarters out of China following the Chinese government's increasing regulation of cryptocurrency. In 2021, Binance was put under investigation by both the United States Department of Justice and Internal Revenue Service on allegations of money laundering and tax offenses. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority ordered Binance to stop all regulated activity in the United Kingdom in June 2021. In 2021, Binance shared client data, including names and addresses, with the Russian government.  <br><br> Binance Careers: Binance Core Values guide our behavior, decisions, and action, enabling unified collaboration across our diverse, international teams. <br> User-Focused <br>We protect our users by putting our users' needs first and delivering quality service. <br> Freedom <br>We execute responsibly and autonomously.
