Discover for yourself what makes interning at Meta the ultimate learning experience. <br><br> Perks Of Internship At Meta:- <br>- You'll be paired with a 1:1 mentor, receive support from your manager and have access to the entire Meta employee community to ensure your success. <br>- Whether you're graduating and seeking a full-time position after your internship, or hoping to return for another internship next year, you'll be considered for a returning offer during your internship. <br>- Weâ€™ll help you have fun outside of work with events, community connection, and networking events with Meta leaders and other activities. <br>- You'll hit the ground runningâ€”most interns ship code or contribute to real-world projects in their first week. <br>- In addition to the benefits full-time employees enjoy, you'll receive housing assistance for the duration of your on-site internship. <br><br> Message For University Grads:- <br>Start your career by doing something meaningful. You'll hit the ground running, learn from the best in the industry and build technologies used by billions of people around the world. There's no limit to the impact you can make at Meta. <br><br> Note: Meta is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer.
