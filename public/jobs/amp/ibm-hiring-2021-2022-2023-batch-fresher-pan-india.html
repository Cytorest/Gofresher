The company began in 1911, founded in Endicott, New York, by trust businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was renamed \"International Business Machines\" in 1924. IBM is incorporated in New York. IBM produces and sells computer hardware, middleware and software, and provides hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. IBM is also a major research organization, holding the record for most annual U.S. patents generated by a business (as of 2021) for 29 consecutive years. Inventions by IBM include the automated teller machine (ATM), the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the SQL programming language, the UPC barcode, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). The IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360, was the dominant computing platform during the 1960s and 1970s. IBM is one of 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and one of the world's largest employers, with over 282,100 employees as of 2022. IBM was founded in 1911 in Endicott, New York, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was renamed \"International Business Machines\" in 1924. IBM is incorporated in New York and has operations in over 170 countries. In the 1880s, technologies emerged that would ultimately form the core of International Business Machines (IBM). Julius E. Pitrap patented the computing scale in 1885; Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888); Herman Hollerith (1860â€“1929) patented the Electric Tabulating Machine; and Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record a worker's arrival and departure time on a paper tape in 1889. On June 16, 1911, their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) based in Endicott, New York. The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto.","datePosted":"2022-12-03","validThrough":"2023-12-03","employmentType":"Full-Time","hiringOrganization":{"@type":"Organization","name":"IBM Corporation","sameAs":"https://www.ibm.com/in-en","logo":"https://gofresher.in/company-logos/ibm.png"},"jobLocation":{"@type":"Place","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"XJ3V+5HP, Embassy Golf Links Road, Embassy Golf Links Business Park, Domlur, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560071","addressLocality":"India","addressRegion":"Bengaluru, Karnataka","postalCode":"560071","addressCountry":"India"}},"baseSalary":{"@type":"MonetaryAmount","currency":"INR","value":{"@type":"QuantitativeValue","value":"450000","unitText":"Yearly"}}}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"NewsArticle","sameAs":"","dateCreated":"2022-12-03T00:00:00+05:30","description":"IBM Hiring Fresher Software Developers, UI Developers, Data Scientists & QA Engineers At Pune, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, PAN India.2021, 2022 & 2023 Batch Fresher Hiring.","dateModified":"2022-12-03T00:00:00+05:30","datePublished":"2022-12-03T00:00:00+05:30","mainEntityOfPage":"https://gofresher.in/jobs/ibm-hiring-2021-2022-2023-batch-fresher-pan-india.html","headline":"IBM Hiring 2021, 2022 & 2023 Batch Freshers PAN India","articleBody":"<br><br> Application For Open Positions and Careers Opportunities For Freshers At IBM India: We continuously invest in up-skilling and re-skilling our workforce.

Pitrap patented the computing scale in 1885; Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888); Herman Hollerith (1860â€“1929) patented the Electric Tabulating Machine; and Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record a worker's arrival and departure time on a paper tape in 1889. On June 16, 1911, their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) based in Endicott, New York. The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto.</span><br><br><span class="postings">Date Posted: </span><span class="postings-text" id="date-posted">2022-12-03</span><br><br><span class="postings">Date Closing: </span> <span class="postings-text" id="date-closing">2023-12-03</span><br><br><span class="postings">Employment Type: </span> <span class="postings-text" id="employment-type">Full-Time</span><br><br><span class="postings">Hiring Organisation Type: </span> <span class="postings-text" id="hiring-organisation-type">Organization</span><br><br><span class="postings">Hiring Organisation Url: </span><span class="postings-text" id="hiring-organisation-url">https://www.ibm.com/in-en</span><br><br><span class="postings">Job Location Address: </span><span class="postings-text" id="location-address">XJ3V+5HP, Embassy Golf Links Road, Embassy Golf Links Business Park, Domlur, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560071</span><br><br><span class="postings">Job Location City: </span><span class="postings-text" id="location-city">Bengaluru</span><br><br><span class="postings">Job Location Region: </span><span class="postings-text" id="location-region">Bengaluru, Karnataka</span><br><br><span class="postings">Job Location Postal Code: </span><span class="postings-text" id="location-postal-code">560071</span><br><br><span class="postings">Job Location Address Country: </span><span class="postings-text" id="location-address-country">India</span><br><br><span class="postings">Salary Currency: </span><span class="postings-text" id="salary-currency">INR</span><br><br><span class="postings">Salary Value: </span><span class="postings-text" id="salary-value">450000</span><br><br><span class="postings">Salary Unit: </span><span class="postings-text" id="salary-unit">Yearly</span><br><br><span class="postings">Application Link: </span><span class="postings-text" id="application-link"><a href="https://www.ibm.com/in-en/employment/entrylevel/#jobs?%23jobs=&job-search=" target="_blank">https://www.ibm.com/in-en/employment/entrylevel/#jobs?%23jobs=&job-search=</a></span><br><br><div class="bottom-gradient" id="bottom-graident-0"><a href="https://gofresher.in/jobs/ibm-hiring-2021-2022-2023-batch-fresher-pan-india.html"><div class="read-full-article" id="read-id-0">Read Full Article</div></a></div></div>
