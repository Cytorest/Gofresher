Like similar companies, Uber has been criticized for the treatment of its drivers as gig workers and independent contractors, disruption of taxicab businesses, and an increase in traffic congestion. The company has been criticized for various unethical practicesâ€”many revealed by a massive document leak in July 2022â€”and for ignoring local regulations. Uber is regulated in many jurisdictions and the company has been banned in several countries.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Admin Gofresher","sameAs":"https://gofresher.in/author/admin"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Gofresher","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","name":"Gofresher","url":"https://gofresher.in/jobs/amp/gofresher-amp-logo.png"}},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gofresher.in/company-logos/uber.png","width":"1200","height":"1200"}}</script><link rel="canonical" href="https://gofresher.in/jobs/uber-technologies-hiring-2021-2022-2023-batch-fresher-pan-india.html">

(Uber), based in San Francisco, provides mobility as a service, ride-hailing (allowing users to book a car and driver to transport them in a way similar to a taxi), food delivery (Uber Eats and Postmates), package delivery, couriers, and freight transportation. Via partnerships with other operators such as Thames Clippers (boats) and Lime (electric bicycles and motorized scooters), users are also able to book other modes of transport through the Uber platform in some locations. Uber sets fares, which vary using a dynamic pricing model based on local supply and demand at the time of the booking and are quoted to the customer in advance, and receives a commission from each booking. It had operations in approximately 72 countries and 10,500 cities as of December 31, 2021. Uber offers many different types of ride options. UberX is the most popular and the standard service of the company. UberXL, Uber Comfort, and Uber Black are other options offered by the company. UberXL cars are usually SUV-sized vehicles that can accommodate 6 passengers. Uber's premium service is Uber Black. Uber Black drivers have to be highly rated and drive more luxurious vehicles than UberX and UberXL. Uber Comfort guarantees a newer vehicle with more leg room. In the second quarter of 2022, Uber had 122 million monthly active users worldwide and generated an average of 21 million trips per day. In the United States, as of May 2022, Uber had a 72% market share for ride-sharing and a 27% market share for food delivery. Uber has been so prominent in the sharing economy that commoditization of service industries using computing platforms has been referred to as uberisation, and several startups have described their offerings as "Uber for X". Uber has posted hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in losses each year since 2014 except for 2018, when it exited from the markets in Russia, China, and Southeast Asia in exchange for stakes in rival businesses. Like similar companies, Uber has been criticized for the treatment of its drivers as gig workers and independent contractors, disruption of taxicab businesses, and an increase in traffic congestion. The company has been criticized for various unethical practicesâ€”many revealed by a massive document leak in July 2022â€”and for ignoring local regulations. Uber is regulated in many jurisdictions and the company has been banned in several countries.</span><br><br><span class="postings">Date Posted: </span><span class="postings-text" id="date-posted">2022-12-04</span><br><br><span class="postings">Date Closing: </span> <span class="postings-text" id="date-closing">2023-12-04</span><br><br><span class="postings">Employment Type: </span> <span class="postings-text" id="employment-type">Full-Time</span><br><br><span class="postings">Hiring Organisation Type: </span> <span class="postings-text" id="hiring-organisation-type">Organization</span><br><br><span class="postings">Hiring Organisation Url: </span><span class="postings-text" id="hiring-organisation-url">https://www.uber.com/in/en/</span><br><br><span class="postings">Job Location Address: </span><span class="postings-text" id="location-address">Gate no. 5A, Hitex Exhibition Center, Izzathnagar, Kothaguda, Hyderabad, Telangana 500084</span><br><br><span class="postings">Job Location City: </span><span class="postings-text" id="location-city">Hyderabad</span><br><br><span class="postings">Job Location Region: </span><span class="postings-text" id="location-region">Hyderabad, Telangana</span><br><br><span class="postings">Job Location Postal Code: </span><span class="postings-text" id="location-postal-code">500084</span><br><br><span class="postings">Job Location Address Country: </span><span class="postings-text" id="location-address-country">India</span><br><br><span class="postings">Salary Currency: </span><span class="postings-text" id="salary-currency">INR</span><br><br><span class="postings">Salary Value: </span><span class="postings-text" id="salary-value">450000</span><br><br><span class="postings">Salary Unit: </span><span class="postings-text" id="salary-unit">Yearly</span><br><br><span class="postings">Application Link: </span><span class="postings-text" id="application-link"><a href="https://www.uber.com/in/en/careers/list/?location=IND-Karnataka-Bangalore&location=IND-Telangana-Hyderabad&location=IND-Haryana-Gurgaon&location=IND-Andhra%20Pradesh-Visakhapatnam&location=IND--Remote&department=Engineering&department=Data%20Science&department=Design&department=Advanced%20Technologies%20Group&department=Product" target="_blank">https://www.uber.com/in/en/careers/list/?location=IND-Karnataka-Bangalore&location=IND-Telangana-Hyderabad&location=IND-Haryana-Gurgaon&location=IND-Andhra%20Pradesh-Visakhapatnam&location=IND--Remote&department=Engineering&department=Data%20Science&department=Design&department=Advanced%20Technologies%20Group&department=Product</a></span><br><br><div class="bottom-gradient" id="bottom-graident-0"><a href="https://gofresher.in/jobs/uber-technologies-hiring-2021-2022-2023-batch-fresher-pan-india.html"><div class="read-full-article" id="read-id-0">Read Full Article</div></a></div></div>
