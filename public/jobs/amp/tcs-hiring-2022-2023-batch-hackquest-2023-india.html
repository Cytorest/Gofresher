The rise of ethical hacking has emerged as a much-needed counter control to organized and state sponsored hacking activities. Given the compulsion of the recent pandemic, end points of organizations have also \"gone home\", it is essential now more than ever for the massive ethical hacking community to be ready to keep a hawk's eye on this. <br><br> We need to create an army to protect data with the same zealousness of an army that guards a country's physical borders. We need them to be conversant with the way data is stored, moved, and used. With the network line blurred between office and home, our data is more at risk than ever before. How can we ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data? <br><br> In this backdrop, TCS Cyber Security Unit is looking for students and enthusiasts who have a passion for ethical hacking and in general securing the digital future of organizations engaged in transacting millions of data points across the world! <br><br> The Contest <br>HackQuest started in 2016 as an earnest attempt to unearth specific talents who exceled in playing their favorite game – Catch the Flag! Based on the popular ‘Catch the Flag' (CTF) format, the contest presents a set of challenges to be completed in 6 hours. Each challenge evaluates their ethical hacking skills and their special competency in finding vulnerabilities. In the end, associates are awarded with special prizes and potential job offers from TCS in the Cyber Security Unit. <br><br> Participation <br>The contest is open for the 2022 and 2023 batch of B.Tech / M.Tech / BCA / MCA / BSc / MSc from all disciplines and all the relevant institutes in India. <br><br> Discipline <br>Students from all IT & Computer Science related disciplines with bachelor's or master's degree are eligible for the contest provided that they meet the TCS recruitment criteria. Candidates trained in Security domains as listed below would be given more preference: <br>- Application Security <br>- Network Security <br>- Java/J2EE, php, python.
