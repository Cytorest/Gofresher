Since 2017, the company has been an independent subsidiary of Samsung Electronics. Headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, US, Harman maintains major operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Harman markets its products under various brands, including AKG, AMX, Arcam, Bang & Olufsen Automotive, Becker, BSS Audio, Crown, dbx, DOD Electronics, DigiTech, Harman Kardon, Infinity, JBL, Lexicon, Mark Levinson, Martin, Revel, Soundcraft and Studer. Sidney Harman and Bernard Kardon founded the predecessor to Harman International, Harman Kardon, in 1953. Both Harman and Kardon were engineers by training and had worked at the Bogen Company, which was a manufacturer of public address systems. They developed high-fidelity audio together. Harman bought out his partner in 1956 and then expanded Harman Kardon into an audio powerhouse, according to a biography written by the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame. In the 1960s, Harman Kardon grew larger and acquired other audio houses (such as JBL). In the 1970s, Harman accepted an appointment in the Carter administration as deputy secretary of the Department of Commerce. When Harman took office in 1976 as head in charge, he sold his company to conglomerate Beatrice Foods to avoid a conflict of interest. Beatrice promptly sold many portions of the company, including the original Harman Kardon division, and by 1980 only 60% of the original company remained. After he left his government position in 1978, he created Harman International Industries and reacquired a number of businesses he sold to Beatrice. The company continued its growth plan with a string of acquisitions throughout the 1980s that pushed Harman International's sales from about $80 million in 1981 to more than $200 million by 1986, and then to more than $500 million by 1989. Harman International went public in 1986 with a stock offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Cash from that sale was used to, among many other purchases, buy Soundcraft, a UK producer of professional mixing boards, in 1988 and later â€“ Salt Lake City digital electronics producer DOD Electronics Corp. By 1994, Harman International was selling consumer audio gear under such brands as JBL, Harman Kardon, Infinity and Epicure loudspeakers, as well as professional audio systems with such brands as JBL Professional, UREI, Soundcraft, Allen & Heath, dbx, Studer, DOD, Lexicon, AKG, BSS, Orban, Quested and Turbosound.","datePosted":"2022-12-02","validThrough":"2023-12-30","employmentType":"Full-Time","hiringOrganization":{"@type":"Organization","name":"HARMAN International","sameAs":"https://www.harman.com/","logo":"https://gofresher.in/company-logos/harman.png"},"jobLocation":{"@type":"Place","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"Harman International India Pvt Ltd Sattva Knowledge Court, 20 21, 7th Cross Rd, Green Domain Layout, EPIP Zone, Whitefield, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560048","addressLocality":"India","addressRegion":"Bengaluru, Karnataka","postalCode":"560048","addressCountry":"India"}},"baseSalary":{"@type":"MonetaryAmount","currency":"INR","value":{"@type":"QuantitativeValue","value":"500000","unitText":"Yearly"}}}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"NewsArticle","sameAs":"","dateCreated":"2022-12-02T00:00:00+05:30","description":"Apply For Internships Opportunities By HARMAN International In India. 2023 Batch Fresher Internship Opportunities In Bangalore.","dateModified":"2022-12-02T00:00:00+05:30","datePublished":"2022-12-02T00:00:00+05:30","mainEntityOfPage":"https://gofresher.in/jobs/harman-international-internships-india-2023.html","headline":"Internships | HARMAN International, India","articleBody":"<br><br> Students & Interns:  <br>With hundreds of students across multiple global locations, HARMAN is dedicated to empowering students at every level through our programs, partnerships and more. <br><br> At HARMAN, our interns and co-ops are the livelihood of our organization!
