Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants as well as food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities. As of 2019, the service is available in 24 countries and in more than 10,000 cities. Zomato is an online food discovery platform with presence across 20 countries including UK, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, Turkey, India, UAE, Portugal, Czech, Slovakia, Poland, South Africa, Qatar and Sri Lanka.   We will launch in Australia (www.zomato.com) in the coming weeks providing detailed information (scanned menus, pictures, map coordinates, user ratings & reviews) for restaurants across the country. Started in India in 2008, we now globally cater to over 30 Million visitors searching for eating out options on a monthly basis, and provide information for more than 300,000 restaurants. Zomato is funded by InfoEdge and Sequoia Capital, the same investors who funded Apple, Cisco, LinkedIn etc and the ambition for Zomato is to become the Google of food globally.Zomato was founded as FoodieBay in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah who worked for Bain & Company. They renamed the company Zomato in 2010 as they were unsure if they would \"just stick to food\" and also to avoid a potential naming conflict with eBay.In 2011, it expanded across India to Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad. In 2012, it expanded operations internationally in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lanka, Qatar, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, and South Africa. In 2013, expanded to in New Zealand, Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia, with website and apps available in Turkish, Portuguese, Indonesian and English languages. In April 2014, it launched in Portugal, which was followed by launches in Canada, Lebanon and Ireland in 2015. With the introduction of .xxx domains in 2011, Zomato also launched zomato.xxx, a site dedicated to food porn. In May 2012, it launched a print version of the website named \"Citibank Zomato Restaurant Guide,\" in collaboration with Citibank, but it has since been discontinued. In January 2015, Zomato acquired Seattle-based restaurant discovery portal Urbanspoon, which led to the firm's entry into the United States and Australia. This U.S.-expansion brought Zomato into direct competition with similar models such as Yelp and Foursquare. Later that month, it acquired the Turkish restaurant discovery platform Mekanist.
