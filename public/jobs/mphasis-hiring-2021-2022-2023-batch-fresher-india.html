The company provides infrastructure technology and applications outsourcing services, as well as architecture guidance, application development and integration, and application management services. It serves financial services, telecom, logistics, and technology industries. Mphasis was ranked #7 in India IT companies and overall #189 by Fortune India 500 in 2019. In April 2016, Hewlett Packard Enterprise sold the majority of its stake in Mphasis to Blackstone Group LP for around US$1 billion. Mphasis was formed in June 2000 after the merger of the US-based IT consulting company Mphasis Corporation (founded in 1998 in Santa Monica by Jerry Rao and Jeroen Tas.) and the Indian IT services company BFL Software Limited (founded in 1992). In June 2006 Electronic Data Systems (EDS) purchased a controlling stake in the company (42%) for $380 million and operated the company as an independent EDS unit. On 13 May 2008, Hewlett-Packard confirmed that it had reached a deal with Electronic Data Systems to acquire the company for $13.9 billion. The deal was completed on 26 August 2008. <br><br> In September 2009 Mphasis changed its brand identity by dropping EDS association to become \"Mphasis, an HP Company\" after HP retired EDS Brand to become \"HP Enterprise Services\". Mphasis operated as an independent HP subsidiary with its own board and continued to be listed on Indian markets as \"Mphasis Limited\". HP owned close to 62% in Mphasis and Mphasis got around 50% of its revenues from HP. <br><br> Mphasis marked $1 billion in revenues and registered a consolidated revenue of Rs 50.37 billion ($1,099.3 million) for the year ended 31 October 2010 becoming the sixth Indian IT company to do that. <br><br> In February 2014, Mphasis changed its logo and the brand name as Mphasis Unleash the Next, seeking to boost business other than from parent Hewlett-Packard, its largest client. <br><br> On 30 June 2015, Mphasis announced the signing of a definitive agreement to transfer a significant portion of its domestic business, to Hinduja Global Solutions (HGS). On 10 July 2015, Mphasis announced it will move 2,000 employees to Karvy Data Management Services Ltd (KDMSL) as part of a deal signed to partially sell its domestic outsourcing business to Karvy. <br><br> <span class=\"postings\">Career At MPhasis:</span> <br><br> #WeAreMphasis India <br><br>At Mphasis we believe that our business will have access to only half of the human potential available to us if women are not an equal and meaningful part of our organization.
