Hike works offline through SMS and has multi-platform support. The app registration uses standard one time password (OTP) based authentication process. Hike is estimated at a value of $1.4 billion, with more than 100 million registered users and 350 employees. Hike Messenger launched globally on 12 December 2012 by founder Kavin Bharti Mittal. Over the next couple of months, features such as free text messaging, themes, stickers, and a hidden chat option were introduced. The majority users are from India with 80 percent under the age group of 25. After buying US based free voice calling company Zip Phones in 2015, Hike started providing free voice calling over cellular network and WiFi across the globe before WhatsApp by optimizing voice quality while using low bandwidth which packs more minutes per megabyte (MB) of data. The company went on to purchased startups like TinyMogul and Hoppr in the later part of 2015. After getting 30 percent sticker usage traffic, Hike launched the 'Great Indian Sticker Challenge' on 5 March 2015 to create more stickers. Hike acquired InstaLively Livestreaming Pvt. Ltd in February 2017 which was behind the hyper local social networking app Pulse, that focused on instant audio and video digitization by using lower bandwidth speed which made it cost-effective for enterprises to create and broadcast content from any remote location. From version 5.0, it became the first social messaging app to start a mobile payment service in India. The timeline feature came back after multiple user request and introduction of a personalized digital envelope called Blue Packets for sending monetary gifts through built-in wallet. In 2017, acquisition of Bengaluru based startup Creo was announced to enable third-party developers build services on top of Hike platform. From 2018, Hike decided to bring 1 billion users online by targeting tier-2 and tier-3 cities by giving more localized services. The company decided to dump the previous super app approach as of January 2019 and is now looking at launching multiple specialized apps for specific users. In May 2019, Hike announced collaboration with Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIIT-D) for developing artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), speech, link prediction, deep learning and computer vision. The company launched the first standalone app Hike Sticker Chat in April 2019, while a separate content app is now called Hike News & Content. With the help of machine learning, Hike Sticker Chat can now recommend, suggest and smartly predicts custom stickers for different situations and mood. Hike launched an animated sticker for Valentine's Day 2019 with a special pack for the LGBTQ community. Due to multilingual nature of Indian society, qwerty keyboards are difficult to localize so Hike is planning to use machine learning to make 80 to 90 percent of sticker-based chat a keyboard-less affair with the help of predictive analysis which now stands at 20 to 30 percent of user conversations on the platform. Hike stickers cover only 15 to 20 percent of vocabulary across 40 languages in India with future focus on text messages and symbols to achieve 100 percent prediction rate that gives a seamless experience while reducing keyboard dependency. As of 2020. Hike was creating a smaller smart team of employees with game designers, crypto-economists and psychologists to understand the emerging digital landscape and create a new type of block-chain economy for its newly launched service called Hike Land. <br><br> Description <br> At Hike, we’re building the Rush Gaming Universe 🎮 📲 💰 <br><br> Skills & experience we're looking for 👨&zwj;💻 <br>- Expertise in animating vector graphics using After Effects. <br>- A stellar portfolio + reel that shows the creative range and innovative thinking <br>- A never-ending desire to learn new techniques and technology to advance your craft <br>- Superb visual and conceptual skills to solve problems and create novel solutions <br>- Experience with Animate, Illustrator, etc. to create vector graphics. <br>- Ability to produce great work in short timeframes, and manage time efficiently while multitasking <br>- A Self-starter, with a willingness to go beyond. <br>- Energetic and Hunger to lead as an individual and grow. <br>- Great attention to detail, proactiveness, and passion for gaming is a pre-requisite. <br><br> You will 📲 <br>- Create an innovative holistic UI Motion system. <br>- Assist in creating effective, compelling stories. <br>- Work with designers to apply user-centered design processes to solve new and unique problems. <br>- Collaborate closely with interaction designers, visual designers, and developers. <br>- Work on all animations for Rush Games Animation (VFX, Particle Effects, Object animation, etc.) <br>- Take initiative on projects to over-deliver new and innovative solutions <br><br> 💰 Benefits → We have tremendous benefits & perks.
