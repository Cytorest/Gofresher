Dell sells personal computers (PCs), servers, data storage devices, network switches, software, computer peripherals, HDTVs, cameras, printers, and electronics built by other manufacturers. The company is known for how it manages its supply chain and electronic commerce. This includes Dell selling directly to customers and delivering PCs that the customer wants. Dell was a pure hardware vendor until 2009 when it acquired Perot Systems. Dell then entered the market for IT services. The company has expanded storage and networking systems, now aiming to expand from offering computers only to delivering a range of technology for enterprise customers. <br>Dell was a publicly-traded company (Nasdaq: DELL), as well as a component of the NASDAQ-100 and S&P 500. It is the 3rd largest personal computer vendor as of January 2021. Dell is ranked 31st on the Fortune 500 list in 2022, up from 76th in 2021. It is also the sixth-largest company in Texas by total revenue, according to Fortune magazine. It is the second-largest non-oil company in Texas. <br>In 2015, Dell acquired the enterprise technology firm EMC Corporation. Dell and EMC became divisions of Dell Technologies. Dell EMC sells data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, and cloud computing. Michael Dell founded Dell Computer Corporation, doing business as PC's Limited, in 1984 while a student at the University of Texas at Austin. Operating from Michael Dell's off-campus dormitory room at Dobie Center, the start-up aimed to sell IBM PC-compatible computers built from stock components. Michael Dell started trading in the belief that by selling personal computer systems directly to customers, PC's Limited could better understand customers' needs and provide the most effective computing solutions to meet those needs. Michael Dell dropped out of college upon completion of his freshman year at the University of Texas at Austin in order to focus full-time on his fledgling business, after getting about $1,000 in expansion-capital from his family. As of April 2021, Michael Dell's net worth was estimated to be over $50 billion. In 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design — the \"Turbo PC\", sold for US$795  — containing an Intel 8088-compatible processor capable of running at a maximum speed of 6.66 MHz. PC's Limited advertised the systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers, and custom assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options. This offered buyers prices lower than those of retail brands, but with greater convenience than assembling the components themselves. Although not the first company to use this business model, PC's Limited became one of the first to succeed with it. The company grossed more than $73 million in its first year of trading. <br>The company dropped the PC's Limited name in 1987 to become Dell Computer Corporation and began expanding globally. At the time, the reasoning was this new company name better reflected its presence in the business market, as well as resolved issues with the use of \"Limited\" in a company name in certain countries. The company set up its first international operations in Britain; eleven more followed within the next four years. In June 1988, Dell Computer's market capitalization grew by $30 million to $80 million from its June 22 initial public offering of 3.5 million shares at $8.50 a share. In 1989, Dell Computer set up its first on-site service programs in order to compensate for the lack of local retailers prepared to act as service centers. <br><br> About This Position: The Software Engineering team delivers next-generation software application enhancements and new products for a changing world.
