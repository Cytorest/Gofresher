It operates a national LTE network with coverage across all 22 telecom circles. Currently, Jio offers 4G and 4G+ services all over India and 5G service in selected cities. Its 6G services are in the works. <br> Jio soft launched on 27 December 2015 with a beta for partners and employees, and became publicly available on 5 September 2016. It is the largest mobile network operator in India and the third largest mobile network operator in the world with over 42.62 crore (426.2 million) subscribers. <br> In September 2019, Jio launched a fiber to the home service, offering home broadband, television, and telephone services. As of September 2020, Reliance Industries has raised ₹1.65 lakh crore (US$21 billion) by selling nearly 33% equity stake in Jio Platforms. <br> The company was registered in Ambawadi, Ahmedabad, Gujarat on 15 February 2007 as Infotel Broadband Services Limited (IBSL). In June 2010, Reliance Industries (RIL) bought a 95% stake in IBSL for ₹4,800 crore (equivalent to ₹91 billion or US$1.1 billion in 2020). Although unlisted, IBSL was the only company that won broadband spectrum in all 22 circles in India in the 4G auction that took place earlier that year. Later continuing as RIL's telecom subsidiary, Infotel Broadband Services Limited was renamed as Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (RJIL) in January 2013. <br> In June 2015, Jio announced that it would start its operations throughout the country by the end of 2015. However, four months later in October, the company postponed the launch to the first quarter of the financial year 2016–2017. Later, in July 2015, a PIL filed in the Supreme Court by an NGO called the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, through Prashant Bhushan, challenged the grant of a pan-India license to Jio by the Government of India. The PIL also alleged that the firm was being allowed to provide voice telephony along with its 4G data service, by paying an additional fee of just ₹165.8 crore (US$21 million) which was arbitrary and unreasonable, and contributed to a loss of ₹2,284.2 crore (US$290 million) to the exchequer. The Indian Department of Telecommunications (DoT), however, explained that the rules for 3G and BWA spectrum didn't restrict BWA winners from providing voice telephony. As a result, the PIL was revoked, and the accusations were dismissed. <br> The 4G services were launched internally on 27 December 2015. The company commercially launched its 4G services on 5 September 2016, offering free data and voice services until 31 December, which was later extended until 31 March 2017.  Within the first month, Jio announced that it had acquired 1.6 crore (16 million) subscribers, and has crossed 5 crore (50 million) subscriber mark in 83 days since its launch, subsequently crossing 100 million subscribers on 22 February 2017. By October 2017, it had about 13 crore (130 million) subscribers. <br> On 5 October 2022, it has launched 5G services to Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. <br><br> Vacanies For Freshers At Jio: There are multiple vacacnies for freshers at Jio.

The Indian Department of Telecommunications (DoT), however, explained that the rules for 3G and BWA spectrum didn't restrict BWA winners from providing voice telephony. As a result, the PIL was revoked, and the accusations were dismissed. <br> The 4G services were launched internally on 27 December 2015. The company commercially launched its 4G services on 5 September 2016, offering free data and voice services until 31 December, which was later extended until 31 March 2017.  Within the first month, Jio announced that it had acquired 1.6 crore (16 million) subscribers, and has crossed 5 crore (50 million) subscriber mark in 83 days since its launch, subsequently crossing 100 million subscribers on 22 February 2017. By October 2017, it had about 13 crore (130 million) subscribers. <br> On 5 October 2022, it has launched 5G services to Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. <br><br> Vacanies For Freshers At Jio: There are multiple vacacnies for freshers at Jio.
